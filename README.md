# AssignmentLRUCache
AssignmentLRUCache is a caching project with LRU(Least Recently Used) cache-policy.

## Structure/Design

```python

|-+ docs
|
|-+ src
  |-+ com
  | |-+ assignment
  |   |-+ client
  |   | |-> Application (main class)
  |   |
  |   |-+ engine
  |     |-+ cachepolicy
  |     | |-> LRUCache (class)
  |     |
  |     |-+ dba
  |     | |-> DiscMemory (class)
  |     |
  |     |-+ ds
  |     | |-> DoublyLinkedList (class)
  |     |
  |     |-> ServeData (class)
  |
  |-+ lru_cache.log
```

## Assumptions
I assumed `engine` is a separate entity to serve user profile based on `client` request in design to make code more understandable.

`com.assignment.engine.dba` will handle the database/disc connectivity but here I have loaded all the data in a static format(in memory).

## Design Choices
*`com.assignment.client.Application`* is a main class to make requests for random user's profile.

*`com.assignment.engine.cachepolicy.LRUCache`* is a class to handle the LRU cache and policy.

*`com.assignment.engine.dba.DiscMemory`* is a class to handle secondary storage.

*`com.assignment.engine.ds.DoublyLinkedList`* is a data structure class to maintain LRU data in cache memory.

*`com.assignment.engine.ServeData`* class will serve all the request generated by `client.Application` and manage the call between _LRUCache_ and _Secondary storage_.

*`lru_cache.log`* is a log file.
